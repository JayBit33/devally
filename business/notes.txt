GREAT ADVICE FROM INDUSTRY PROFESSIONALS

ANALYTICS!! MUST HAVE KNOW WHERE YOUR USERS SPEND THE MOST TIME AND DON'T.

TODOS
Get MVP out ASAP
Get initial Users
Talk to users and get feedback
iterate (Improve the product)

Lean MVP
Very fast to build (weeks not months) - landing page and form
Very limited functionality
Appeal to a small set of users ( not every possible user)
Base to iterate from


Remember launch is only a big deal for you not for your users.
